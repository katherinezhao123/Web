    <h2>What type of snow should I use?</h2>
    <p><b>Always use packable snow!</b> Sometimes, when snow falls, it doesnt still and turns into this sloppy wet mush. There is an actual science behind
      <a href="https://www.kare11.com/article/weather/weather-minds/snow-types-sledding-or-snowman/89-8f0962c3-2233-4a52-9634-39f957167ad7#:~:text=It's%20warmer%20temperatures%20near%20the%20freezing%20mark%20that%20make%20wet%20snow."> different types of snow.</a>
  Essentially, it is important that in order to create a snowman that can hold up to the weight, meaning that snow <b>must</b> be packable. </p>

 <!-- Second section, bold tag used within another tag, like paragraph.  -->
<h2>How big should I make the snowman, and how should I shape it?</h2>
<p><b>A snowman can be as big or as small as you'd like!</b> It also depends on the amount of usable snow available. To shape a three part snowman, start at the base. I like to make a big mound of packed snow, and then buuild up on it, shaping it to a spherical- like hill with a flat top.
This allows us to set the next part, the body, on top of it evenly. Depending on the size of the snowman, I like to start with a small snowball, and roll it around in more snow, packing as I go, to get to a sphere of decent size. I set it upon the mound, packing more snow at the base to secure it.
 For the head, I repeat what I did with thebody, only making it smaller. I pack snow at the body to secure the head, and add snow where necessary to round out the form.  Here is an example of a snowman being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wOPaLD1VrA">built.</a></p>

 <!-- Third Section-->
 <h2>How should I customize it?</h2>
 <p><b>Always name your snowman!</b> It seems so miniscule, but it really personalizes your snowman! I name all of mine Albert, starting from Albet 0 to Albert 5. I like to go natural with my decorations, using twigs, rocks, burrs, and really anything found inmy backyard. You could go the
classic route, using scarves, carrots, and a top hat for a frosty-the-snowman look. The snowman is your blank canvas, and can represent whatever you want it to look like. Here are some <a href="https://www.pennlive.com/midstate/2011/01/how_to_build_a_better_snowman.html">suggestions</a>!</p>
